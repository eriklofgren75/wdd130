      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of this portfolio is to provide examples of 3D designs and code for computer programs.
        This will be done through showing examples of computer aided designs, and 3D printed objects.
        Also we'll look at raw code and running programs for computer coding.

        About me:
        My name is Erik Lofgren. I am a current stutdent at BYU Idaho. I am majoring in Applied Bussiness with a minor Web and Software Development.

        About CAD:
        Computer Aided Design (CAD) is the process of using computer software to create designs for various purposes including, but not limited to engineering,
        architecture, and manufacturing. You can use CAD software create simple or complex 2D or 3D models. You can use CAD for simulations, stress testing, prototyping,
        and many other processes.

        About Computer Programming:
        Computer programming is the process of writing, testing, and maintaining the instructions that a computer follows to perform various tasks.
        The instructions, code, are written in various syntax, such as JavaScript, Python, and many other types of languages.
        People write code for software, websites, and other applications. It is necessary to debug errors, optimize performance, as well as ensure security.

        On this page I will showcase computer aided designs designed by me. I prinicpally have used CAD software, primarily Fusion 360 and Blender, to design 3D prints.
        As a teenager I wanted to become an architect, so one project I am incredibly proud of is is designing a model of the Salt Lake City Temple.
        Though not completely scale, or bearing every detail, I think this model is incredibly detailed in comparison to the real building. The 3D print
        is a half scale model of the CAD design and bears remarkable detail even at that scale. I have also made many other things on the software such as earings
        in the shape of an angler fish for my sister, who majors in marine biology.
        I am also currently engaged in a few desings that I can use to potentially 3D print and sale.

      <h3>[Page 3]</h3>
      <p>
        A long interest of mine has been computer programming. In the past I have tinkered with game development.
        Because by the end of my schooling I will have an associates degree in web and software development I will have significant training in coding.
        This page will primarily focus on programs that I have designed, both for school projects, as well as personal projects.
