        <h4>On this page I will showcase computer aided designs designed by me. I prinicpally have used CAD software, primarily Fusion 360 and Blender, to design 3D prints.
        As a teenager I wanted to become an architect, so one project I am incredibly proud of is is designing a model of the Salt Lake City Temple.
        Though not completely scale, or bearing every detail, I think this model is incredibly detailed in comparison to the real building.</h4>

        <h5> The 3D print
            is a half scale model of the CAD design and bears remarkable detail even at that scale. I have also made many other things on the software such as earings
            in the shape of an angler fish for my sister, who majors in marine biology.
            I am also currently engaged in a few desings that I can use to potentially 3D print and sale.</h5>
