    <h2>Erik Lofgren</h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Erik Lofgren.
    I live in Utah with my wife. We have been married since May.
    I am currently majoring in Bussiness for a bachelors
    <p>I enjoy oil painting in my spare time. Though between school, work, and family I hardly seem to be able to find it.</p>
    The biggest advantage I see from programming and web development is that any job where computers are even slightly involved
        no one will question my competence with them.
     <p>And I have been a life long member of the Church.</p>
    </p>
